4. set driver location as $PATH variable: 
    4a. edit .bashrc in your home directory (for example: nano .bashrc)
    4b. add a line with your geckodriver location directory:  (for me it was: export PATH=$PATH:"/home/mrrys00/Documents/Tests/WebDriversForUITests/firefoxDriver" )
    4c. save .bashrc (click: Ctrl + S) and exit (Ctrl + X)
    4d. close all your terminals (exit command)
