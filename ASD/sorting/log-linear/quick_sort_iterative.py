# Quick sort algorithm â€“ iterative version (stack)
#
# DESCRIPTION
# Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a pivot (q) element from the array
# and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or
# greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
# The pivot can be chosen in many ways. I could be e.g. the first, the middle or the last element.
# By choosing the last element as the pivot we spare one swap operation each instance.
# 
# COMPLEXITY
# Average time complexity:  O(n log n)
# Pessimistic time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(n)
# This one has space complexity O(1)
